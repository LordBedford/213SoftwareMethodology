| Test Case #   |                                                                                     Purpose of Test Case                                                                                     |                     Input Data                     |                Expected Output |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------: | -----------------------------: |
| 1             |                                      Test method to see if getSize method works. The current ShoppingBag has 0 items so the size returned should be 0.                                       |        ShopppingBag temp = new ShoppingBag         |                              0 |
| 2             |  Test for the add method by adding a single predefined GroceryItem, as the GroceryItem array is private we instead check the size using getSize method which should be valid at this point.  |                  "toast", 4, true                  |                       size = 0 |
| 3             |   Test for the find method using two predefined GroceryItems, one that was previously added and one that should not be present. Index of available should be 1 while missing should be -1.   |  case 1: "toast", 4, true case 2: "jam", 3, false  |        case1: = 1, case2: = -1 |
| 4             |             Test for the salesPrice method by checking the price of two GroceryItems, if the total price is 8 then salesPrice is functional, otherwise there has been an error.              |       {"toast", 4, true},{"toast", 4, false}       |                              8 |
| 5             |          Test the salesTax method by checking the tax of two GroceryItems, the total tax should only include one item, so (4*.06625), if it is not this then the method has failed.          |       {"toast", 4, true},{"toast", 4, false}       |                     (4*.06625) |
| 6             |             Test the remove method by trying to remove the GroceryItem available which was previously added, and trying to remove the GroceryItem missing which was never added.             | case 1: "toast", 4, true, case 2: "jam", 3, false  |     case1 : true, case2: false |
| 7             |      Tests grow method by causing an ArrayIndexIoutOfBoundException by calling add 10 time, while checking size. If size is less than 10 or an exception is thrown, method has failed.       |               {"toast", 4, true}x10                | case1: = N/A, case2: size = 10 |
| 8             |          Tests emptyBag method by checking the size after emtpying and checking for any available GroceryItems. If the size is greater than 0 or items are found method has failed.          |                        N/A                         | case1: = size = 0, case2: = -1 |
